# OLTP-OLAP-on-United-States-H-1B-visa-data-for-operational-usage-and-analytics
## Introduction
By implementing OLTP and OLAP systems on H-1B visa data, we can process real-time data from operational data stores (ODS) and perform analytical tasks on the data warehouse (DWH). The H-1B visa is a nonimmigrant work visa for highly educated foreign professionals in specialty jobs requiring a bachelor's degree or equivalent. Using an Entity Relationship (ER) model derived from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, we developed the OLTP database on a cloud-based MySQL instance. Data from MySQL is extracted, transformed with Python, and loaded into the data warehouse, where analytics are performed and visualized to understand geographical, economical, and educational factors of applicants.
